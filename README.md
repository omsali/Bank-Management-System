# Bank-Management-System

This is a C++ project for a Banking Management System. It allows users to perform various banking operations, such as creating a new account, depositing and withdrawing amounts, checking account balance, modifying account details, closing an account, and generating a list of all account holders.

# Features
**Account Creation**: Users can create new accounts by providing account details such as account number, account holder name, type of account (savings or current), and initial deposit amount.

**Deposit and Withdrawal**: Users can deposit and withdraw amounts from their accounts. The system validates the account balance before allowing withdrawals to ensure sufficient funds are available.

**Balance Enquiry**: Users can check the balance of their accounts by providing the account number.

**Account Modification**: Users can modify account details such as account holder name, type of account, and balance amount.

**Account Closure**: Users can close an account by providing the account number. The system removes the account from the records and updates the account list.

**Account List**: The system provides a list of all account holders, displaying their account number, name, type of account, and balance amount.

**Security**: The system incorporates a PIN (Personal Identification Number) as an additional security measure to protect sensitive customer information. Users must provide the correct PIN to access and perform transactions.

**Data Storage**: The system uses a binary file to store account information, ensuring efficient storage and enhanced data security.
